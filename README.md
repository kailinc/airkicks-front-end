## Wireframes

I had to change the layout of the page because the original wireframes are too complicated
and time consuming to create in 5 days. I still used the original wirefreams as
a guide line to design the layout and create a user friendly website.

## Development Process

Before I start coding, I would always go to the whiteboard to draw out the feature
I was trying to add to the site. The first time I whiteboard it would be a brief
idea of the feature. The second time would be more intense. I would write code
and functions I would need. Then I would look at the whiteboard and think of
steps or events I did not take into account of. This made coding very easy because
the whiteboard would serve as a blue print/check list for me.

Below are pictures of how I whiteboarded features on the website.

At the start of each day or coding session, I would have a plan of action for me
to tackle. This made me focused and know what to do. After completing the tasks
on the plan of action, I would make a new plan of action for me to tackle on my
next coding session.

Below are pictures of my plan of actions.



## Problem Solving Strategy

I would always go to the whiteboard to map out the problem whenever I saw one.
